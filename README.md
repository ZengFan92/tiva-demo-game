Difference : 
1. The second version sometimes may have difficulties in starting the game. Try multiple times if Project-submit.zip fails to begin the game. \n
2. The second version has modified gameover mechanism, but both of them are functional.\n
3. For receiving data, the first one is polling, the second one is using interrupt. The interrupt handler has some problems.
