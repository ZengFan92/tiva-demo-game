ECE353readMe.pdf: Game introduction and comments reference.

Project for grading: Project-submit.zip 

Project more stable but without receiving interrupt: ProjectwithoutWirelessInterrupt.

These 2 files are behaving most the same. 

Difference : 
1. The first version sometimes may have difficulties in starting the game. Try multiple times if Project-submit.zip fails to begin the game. 
2. The first version has modified gameover mechanism, but both of them are functional.
